# LLM Logic Task 6 – Exploring Datalog

This repository contains the deliverables for Task 6 of the LLM+Logic project.  
The focus is on understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) can interact with non-classical logics — specifically Datalog — to enable structured and symbolic reasoning.

## What is Datalog?

Datalog is a declarative logic programming language used for querying relational data.  
It is a subset of Prolog with guaranteed termination, making it ideal for use in reasoning systems and databases. It uses facts, rules, and bottom-up evaluation semantics.

---

## Project Goals

- Study the syntax, semantics, and reasoning style of Datalog
- Explore how LLMs can translate natural language queries into Datalog rules
- Demonstrate reasoning on simple examples using PyDatalog

---

## Deliverables

- One-page tutorial on Datalog syntax, semantics, and tooling
- Slide deck summarizing Datalog and its relevance to LLM-based reasoning

---

## Setup

To run example code using PyDatalog (optional):
```bash
pip install pyDatalog
```
